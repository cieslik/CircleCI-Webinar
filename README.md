Sample setup for a basic Continuous Integration workflow in Circle CI as presented in a webinar with CircleCi on June 27, 2018. See https://www2.circleci.com/cici_workflows_for_sfdx_apps.html

"Salesforce has been investing a lot into their developer experience, including making it easier to continuously update and improve Salesforce apps via the process of continuous integration and delivery. If you've been looking to incorporate more DevOps practices into your Salesforce app development, or are simply looking for a tutorial on CI/CD for Salesforce apps, this webinar is for you.
        ## Requirements
